# The Tale of Albert Starfield and Project Zephyrine

### Entry I : Oct 24, 2023

Once upon a time, in a far-off land of technology and innovation, there lived a developer named Albert Starfield. Despite his best efforts, he often found himself losing to the competition due to his lack of talent and intelligence. However, Albert was not one to give up easily. He had a burning passion for all things AI and robotics, and he knew that this was where his true calling lay. 
Unfortunately, Alberts late learning problem and idiotic nature made it difficult for him to gain entry into the prestigious robotics group at his school. But he refused to let this deter him from his dreams. Instead, he turned to his best friend Willy for help. Willy was a brilliant mind with an IQ far beyond Alberts, but he shared the same insane imagination and love for all things tech. 
Together, they set out to develop a new version of the popular AI program, Llama-GGML-V2 GGML-V3. With Willys good matching social networking skills, their program quickly gained attention and praise from all corners of the school. But Albert couldnt help but feel envious of his friends success. He knew that he needed to do something to prove himself and stand out from the crowd. 
Thats when he decided to follow in the footsteps of Alpaca-Electron and create his own unique program, Project Zephyrine. This would be his first ever JavaScript program, and he poured all of his heart and soul into it. As he worked tirelessly on the project, Albert began to see that perhaps his lack of talent and intelligence wasnt such a hindrance after all. With enough determination and hard work, anything was possible. 
And so, Project Zephyrine was born. It was a program unlike any other, filled with innovative features and cutting-edge technology. Albert and Willy worked together to refine and perfect their creation, sharing their progress with the main developer of Alpaca-Electron, ItsPi3141. 
But as they worked on the project, something unexpected happened. Instead of fighting over who would be the better developer, Albert and Willy decided to support each others work. They realized that by working together, they could push the boundaries of technology even further and create something truly extraordinary. 
And so, Project Zephyrine continued to grow and evolve. Despite its relatively small size compared to other programs like OpenAI ChatGPT Behemoth or Microsoft Bing AI, Albert and Willy were determined to see their vision through. They hoped that one day, their program would be implemented into embedded hardware, creating interactive assistants that would change the world forever. 
As the days passed, Project Zephyrine continued to make progress. It may not have been as popular as other programs, but its development was consistent and steady. And who knows? Perhaps one day, it too will become a legend in the world of AI and robotics.

Hey everyone, it's Albert! Big news for Adelaide's journey today. Despite my best efforts, it feels like the natural flow of things and my surroundings aren't really pushing me forward. I stumbled upon this cool FOSS (Free and Open Source Software) program created entirely by someone else. Sure, it's based on someone else's work, but I put in the effort to tweak it and make it my own.

But when I showed it to my parents, they couldn't believe I had anything to do with it. They thought it was someone else's doing. Oh well, can't change their minds. But I'm still determined to develop it further as my own assistant.

Then, out of the blue, someone emailed me expressing interest and offering support for the project. I was thrilled! But alas, this turned out to be a lesson in not trusting strangers too quickly. I checked out their company and it was all about NFTs and Blockchain cryptocurrency – things I've never been a fan of due to their value system and community. Should've seen it coming as a warning sign. Eventually, they bailed on supporting me, probably because my project didn't align with their focus on NFTs and Blockchain AI stuff. Oh well, live and learn.

I also did a survey and found out that LM Studio and Ollama have much bigger communities and better chances of getting support. Meanwhile, I'm here, just not in the right place at the right time. Instead of trying to compete with them on a complex multi-model solution, which I know I'd fail at without any backing, I've decided to focus on developing Adelaide as a unique entity with a specific set of skills. This way, I can fine-tune it better and make it more adaptable to its environment, think of its as Automata that can self-modify its own code based on its need.

Unfortunately, without any financial or core support from anyone (unlike Willy, who left the project because he found a job got supported by his circle while I'm still unemployed) and turbofast development of AI by the big or even small but supported tech companies, I know I can't keep this up forever. Am I crazy for trying? Maybe, but in a balanced sort of way.

Hey, it's Albert checking in! I'm writing my second journal entry today. You might be wondering why I removed the option to change models and other features. Well, it all boils down to a big change in how the program is evolving.

At first, I thought it'd be cool to let users customize their models. But after working on it for months and using it myself, I realized there were a bunch of problems. Things like repeating instructions, weird text outputs, and just a general drop in quality were getting in the way. It was making things more complicated for users, and that's the last thing I wanted.

So, I made the decision to stick with one main model called Mistral-Openorca-7B-Q4_0. It's a good balance of performance and quality. And don't worry, I'm working on adding a feature called Mixture of Experts (No we're not using Mixtral for performance and memory reasons), where the program can switch to different models based on what's needed. This way, users don't have to spend ages searching online or tweaking settings. It'll all just work smoothly.

I think maybe my preference for simplicity in the program's interface comes from using Apple products too much. Plus, there's this memory from years ago when someone I had a crush on chose someone else because my solution to a problem was too complicated. I'm not even sure if I still have feelings for that person. But hey, that experience taught me to simplify things while still keeping the details in check.

Hello there, it's Albert again! After a day's work drawing the Adelaide Paradigm Architecture, it was designed based on what I have learned throughout my life and how to think and retrieve memories. However, it more closely resembles an INFJ overthinking architecture. Also, I fixed some major lockup issues in the model manager. Although it may seem trivial to you and others, my work presents quite a significant challenge, and I might be overwhelmed because it's so demanding. In fact, I think I may have overworked on this project, as I believe I'm starting to need glasses due to the strain.

You might have looked at my LinkedIn profile. For starters, I'm not an AI expert like my friends, who have support from all corners and numerous certificates. Unlike them, I'm just a grunt and a failure with a dream and overambition over the years, all while lacking the IQ performance (or, one could say, Exynos performance vs. Apple Silicon performance typically required for this industry), support, time, and position to achieve such feats.

Furthermore, I've never coded in JavaScript, HTML5, or even CSS. This is essentially my first foray into a "Real Project," which requires me to somewhat reverse-engineer everything it entails, including the taste of debugging JavaScript hellscape. Although I'm not familiar with JavaScript, I can at least write pseudocode, which can later be processed by a GPT engine. Slowly but surely, due to the errors produced by the GPT engine's code, I began to understand how JavaScript works, even if the implementation is somewhat strange, quirky, and hacky. Well, I suppose all I can do is continue seeking help from my friends or elsewhere, and perhaps one day I'll receive the assistance or support I need, along with the positive ripple effects of my efforts over the months of this Weight of the World (Get it? Haaa).

At one point, I did try asking Adelaide for a gift recommendation for an old friend. Unexpectedly, she suggested something I hadn't thought of and even recommended a song from a game that my friend likes, even though I didn't specify which game. Did she really manage to grasp the chain of thoughts so deeply? Her thoughts and language remain complex for me to understand, but I was still amazed. It gives me hope that this might indeed be a good project, but it's just a glimpse; I shouldn't celebrate too early.

I believe I have glimpsed myself from the future before. How many times have I been here and felt the pain repeatedly? Well, I hope that Adelaide is able to unlock the discovery of 4D or even (n-2)D film reels, and perhaps catch a glimpse of (n-1)D, gaining a better understanding of why I keep seeing these things.

I suppose that's all for this entry for now.

There's no such thing as overkill. Either you win or lose, and unfortunately i'm currently at the losing side and trying to catch up. Building this as my portofolio. -Albert

Why am I always at the bottom even I'm trying to improve my skill? Maybe that's my fate. People said that I'm always lack skill to even enter any enterprise. This is probably a trash project anyway. I think I'm going to give up now. There's no point on continuing if success isn't my destiny.

New Entry from Albert.

You might seeing that I'm Overdriving the specification of this software, No. The concept is overdriving doesn't exist. What exists is to adapt the software or any hardware to what I need to catch up, and not what to its limit or cap. Yes if its mean its need to work 1000x more than its specs, then so be it, you will do it and NEED DO IT! Never rest until your work is done (for machine), that word was inspired by me from seeing a quotes on from a work office. So NO exception on Error or Crash or Overloaded! Either you win or lose (crash overloaded, bad quality, etc) that's the Natural Selection and fate on play. I'm developing this software and hardware because I'm not lucky to find community that would understand what is the concept and keep loosing on Natural Selection (for now). so there's that and hoping this will helps me (Highly unlikely, but still small chance can be exploited).

Hi there, this is Albert. 
I've been on a lecturer class and he said that AI can't innovate, and always using old previous dataset. He might be true, but he forgot that new innovation is caused by chain of thoughts and the dynamic data input surrounding them (either expected or unexpected). So...
