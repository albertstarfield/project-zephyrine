- [x] Accommodates multiple model modes, including llama-2, llama-2-GGUF, llama, and falcon Backend model Mode.
- [x] Offers context memory capabilities.
- [x] Includes a Granular Toggles Mode within the settings section.
- [x] Implements Markdown Formatted Response support.
- [x] Implement Typing-like experience Response Support.
- [x] Progress bar for internal thoughts rather than leaving the user without any information on the GUI why is it Stuck.
- [x] First gemma.cpp engine model modes integration initial implementation (experimental) 
- [x] Re-render old Adelaide Zephyrine Charlotte character from Anything-v3.5 to SDXL+MeinaMix_V11+Anything-v5+ESRGANx2+ESRGANx4 Mix with DDIM DPM2M++ Kerra Euler Ancestral+Euler Kerras scheduler FP16 VAE Fix
- [x] Automata Agent Mode (autoGPT agent like functionality).
- [x] Multi-LLMChild Background Queue Prompt to Experience when can't catch up with QoS time (Improving experience 100B Parameter Adelaide Paradigm Experience) (Backbrain).
- [x] Implementing ms QoS for LLMChild to prevent unecessary Lock-up Implementing a Proactive Lockup Timeout Verification Mechanism in the Quest for External Context Acquisition.
- [x] Developing Workaround for the Adelaide Paradigm Achilles Heel, v8 4GB memory enforced limit by electron. (v8 pointer compression memory heap limitation) (--max-old-space-size=1342177280 Bumping up the size to 1TB) There is no such thing as overkill.
- [x] Implemented UMA MLCMCF "Bigger" context window manager LLM Agnostic design.
- [x] Implement and Replace Context Depth fetching to MLCMCF (Multi Level Condensed Memory Contextual Fetching).
- [x] Facilitates access to local literature documents and resources through local files integration, excluding formatted documents, Implemented using UMA MLCMCF NLP Based matching.
- [x] New JSON interaction database that handles emotion sentiment analysis, more data, side of interaction, and multiple SessionID
- [x] Multi-submission input lifelike input rather than flip-flop wait for response type of classic interaction.
- [x] Interaction Experience UMA MLCMCF Sideloading Subsystem.
- [x] Auto Idle auto general Model Remorphing (Inserting new knowledge nonSFT and SFT Fragment Variant), specLM or specialized Language Model will NOT recieve this treatment!.
#### High Prioirity
- [ ] LLaVa-Next Implementation LLMChild Framebuffer Capture and Camera Capture
- [ ] Expressive Audio Input and Output Interactive Whisper cpp 
- [ ] Auto Idle mainLLM Suspension to save memory and resources
- [ ] OpenAI API Implementation Bridge for Quality Testing standard of the engine model (Scientific Research Requirement using Standard Testing Method).

#### Low Priority
- [ ] Base Models (Not-ReMorph by Zephyrine) into Blockchain type storage IPFS, Compensating the need to use HuggingFace due to random downtime of HF centralized model hub and to compensate post-apocalyptic scenario where internet mostly cut off.
- [ ] Implementing Native Windows Support.


- [ ] Autoexec for generated command Integrating an Environment/Computer Interaction Pipeline, facilitating the execution of AI-generated commands and interacting with Hardware. (OS Adaptive (*nix Bash and Windows Powershell)).
- [ ] Implementing multi language support with Frontend Automatic Translation and Backend EN Processing.
- [ ] AudioLM Integration with Adelaide Paradigm   
- [ ] Self-updating, Self-maintaning, and Self-Adapting Code.
- [ ] Static compilation Mobile (No AI Dynamics on Self-Modification or Special Specific Hardware Compilation), Very strict jailed version of Mobile version for iOS support.
- [ ] Mobile HTML5 UI.
- [ ] Categorize into Classes based on the subsystem drawio for cleaner Code and easier debugging
- [ ] Multi-session Interactions Tab save and restore
- [ ] Bing CoPilot AI and Pinokio AI toolbox inspired, invoked by Text LLM
- [ ] dE_QARE QuestandAchievement (Stable-Diffusion) Engine integration with Adelaide Paradigm
- [ ] Less-Weeb Graphic mode as default due to request of the industry
- [ ] Multi format communication Real-time communication and collaboration (Audio, Video, Actuator)
- [ ] Incorporating the Convolutional Transformer (CvT) within the software framework to serve as the conduit for capturing contextual information from the screen.
- [ ] Adding Docker Support
- [ ] AI Blackbox Issue required Reference if its plausible be like Bing AI on the referencing system (Adapt as factual seeker) (APA7 based referencing system and formatting)
- [ ] Mobile static-version precompiled.
