-   **Title:** Streamline DB Init, Improve Scheduler Resilience, and Add Preemption Check
-   **Status:** In-Progress
-   **Description:** This change involves several refactors and a new feature. The database initialization logic was simplified by removing the complex Alembic "stamp and upgrade" process in favor of a more direct `create_all` approach, and the background health check thread was removed. The DCTD scheduler is now more aggressive, attempting to connect to the database immediately upon startup without waiting for a health signal. A new `is_preempted` method was added to the `PriorityQuotaLock` to allow tasks to check if they have been preempted by a higher-priority task. Finally, `datetime` imports were standardized to `import datetime as dt` to prevent import shadowing.

-   **Title:** Integrate STEM Compass MoE Models
-   **Status:** Resolved
-   **Description:** This feature integrates a suite of specialized Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models, collectively named "STEM Compass," into the cortex. The launcher (`launcher.py`) has been updated to download these new GGUF models, and the `CortexConfiguration.py` has been modified to map them for use by the LLM worker. The total model parameter count has been updated to 77.05B to reflect these additions. The `.gitignore` file was also updated to exclude temporary build artifacts.
-   **ID:** SYS-PERF-004
-   **Title:** Tune resource limits, improve logging, and relax dependency pinning
-   **Status:** Resolved
-   **Description:** This change introduces several modifications to improve system performance and stability. It adjusts resource limits in `CortexConfiguration.py` for background tasks, database truncation length, and logging to reduce memory footprint and increase responsiveness. Logging is now more frequent with smaller batch sizes. Dependency versions in `requirements.txt` have been relaxed from `==` to `>=` to allow for more flexible package updates. Error handling in the `file_indexer.py` has been improved with a try-except block for image processing. `ENABLE_DB_DELETE_DEFECTIVE_ENTRY` has been enabled to allow for automated cleanup of defective database entries.

-   **Title:** Remove unused streaming timer logic in ChatPage
-   **Status:** In-Progress
-   **Description:** Refactored the `ChatPage.jsx` component to remove the `streamingStartTimeRef` and the related tokens-per-second calculation. This logic was unused and added unnecessary complexity to the component's state management during message streaming.
