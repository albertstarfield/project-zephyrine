-   **Title:** Streamline DB Init, Improve Scheduler Resilience, and Add Preemption Check
-   **Status:** In-Progress
-   **Description:** This change involves several refactors and a new feature. The database initialization logic was simplified by removing the complex Alembic "stamp and upgrade" process in favor of a more direct `create_all` approach, and the background health check thread was removed. The DCTD scheduler is now more aggressive, attempting to connect to the database immediately upon startup without waiting for a health signal. A new `is_preempted` method was added to the `PriorityQuotaLock` to allow tasks to check if they have been preempted by a higher-priority task. Finally, `datetime` imports were standardized to `import datetime as dt` to prevent import shadowing.

-   **Title:** Integrate STEM Compass MoE Models
-   **Status:** In-Progress
-   **Description:** This feature integrates a suite of specialized Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models, collectively named "STEM Compass," into the cortex. The update includes a generalist STEM model and specialists for Physics, Chemistry, and Biology. The launcher (`launcher.py`) has been updated to download these new GGUF models, and the `CortexConfiguration.py` has been modified to map them for use by the LLM worker. The total model parameter count has been updated to 77.05B to reflect these additions. The `.gitignore` file was also updated to exclude temporary build artifacts.
