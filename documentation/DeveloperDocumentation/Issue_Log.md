-   **Title:** Refactor QRNN simulation to use GPU-accelerated tensor engine
-   **Status:** Resolved
-   **Description:** Majorly refactored `VectorCompute_Provider.py` to replace the memory-intensive, numpy-based dense matrix simulation with a high-performance, memory-optimized tensor contraction engine. The new engine automatically utilizes PyTorch for GPU acceleration (CUDA, ROCm, MPS) if available, falling back to accelerated CPU routines. This change significantly improves simulation speed and reduces the memory footprint by avoiding the construction of large, dense unitary matrices. The implementation now relies on efficient `tensordot` operations and index permutation for entanglement, which is well-suited for modern hardware. The provider now dynamically selects the best backend (PyTorch, Qiskit, etc.) at initialization. Minor logging noise was reduced in `cortex_backbone_provider.py` and `file_indexer.py`.

-   **Title:** Remove unused datetime import in AdelaideAlbertCortex.py
-   **Status:** Resolved
-   **Description:** Removed an unnecessary `datetime` import from `systemCore/engineMain/AdelaideAlbertCortex.py` to clean up the code.

-   **Title:** Streamline DB Init, Improve Scheduler Resilience, and Add Preemption Check
-   **Status:** In-Progress
-   **Description:** This change involves several refactors and a new feature. The database initialization logic was simplified by removing the complex Alembic "stamp and upgrade" process in favor of a more direct `create_all` approach, and the background health check thread was removed. The DCTD scheduler is now more aggressive, attempting to connect to the database immediately upon startup without waiting for a health signal. A new `is_preempted` method was added to the `PriorityQuotaLock` to allow tasks to check if they have been preempted by a higher-priority task. Finally, `datetime` imports were standardized to `import datetime as dt` to prevent import shadowing.

-   **Title:** Integrate STEM Compass MoE Models
-   **Status:** Resolved
-   **Description:** This feature integrates a suite of specialized Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models, collectively named "STEM Compass," into the cortex. The launcher (`launcher.py`) has been updated to download these new GGUF models, and the `CortexConfiguration.py` has been modified to map them for use by the LLM worker. The total model parameter count has been updated to 77.05B to reflect these additions. The `.gitignore` file was also updated to exclude temporary build artifacts.

-   **Title:** Tune resource limits, improve logging, and relax dependency pinning
-   **Status:** Resolved
-   **Description:** This change introduces several modifications to improve system performance and stability. It adjusts resource limits in `CortexConfiguration.py` for background tasks, database truncation length, and logging to reduce memory footprint and increase responsiveness. Logging is now more frequent with smaller batch sizes. Dependency versions in `requirements.txt` have been relaxed from `==` to `>=` to allow for more flexible package updates. Error handling in the `file_indexer.py` has been improved with a try-except block for image processing. `ENABLE_DB_DELETE_DEFECTIVE_ENTRY` has been enabled to allow for automated cleanup of defective database entries.

-   **Title:** Remove unused streaming timer logic in ChatPage
-   **Status:** In-Progress
-   **Description:** Refactored the `ChatPage.jsx` component to remove the `streamingStartTimeRef` and the related tokens-per-second calculation. This logic was unused and added unnecessary complexity to the component's state management during message streaming.

-   **Title:** Isolate QRNN Numpy Simulation in Subprocess for Memory Safety
-   **Status:** Resolved
-   **Description:** Refactored the `VectorCompute_Provider.py` to execute the memory-intensive QRNN numpy simulation in an isolated subprocess. This prevents the main application from crashing due to excessive memory allocation during large matrix operations (`2^16 x 2^16` matrices). The core logic is now in a standalone `_execute_numpy_qrnn_isolated` function, and the provider orchestrates the subprocess lifecycle, passing data via temporary files. This guarantees that memory used by the simulation is released back to the OS immediately upon completion.
