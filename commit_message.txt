feat(cortex): enhance Warden memory negotiation and model role detection

This commit significantly improves the Warden memory protection layer in the Cortex.

The Warden now dynamically introspects the LangChain chain to detect the specific role of the model being called (e.g., 'coder', 'vlm'), allowing for more accurate memory requirement calculations instead of defaulting to the 'general' model.

The memory negotiation logic has been made more robust. It now incorporates a 20% "best effort" memory overdraft tolerance, allowing operations to proceed even if slightly exceeding available RAM, relying on system swap or compression. This improves resource utilization under memory pressure. Logging has been enhanced to provide step-by-step visibility into the context bin selection process.
