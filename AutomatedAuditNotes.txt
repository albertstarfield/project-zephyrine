Note: The code snippet is a simple log message. It's functionally correct but lacks robustness. 

**Concerns:**

* **Hardcoded Timestamp:** The timestamp is hardcoded. This limits flexibility and makes it difficult to automate checks for installation date.
* **Lack of Context:**  No information about the version of ChatterboxTTS installed is included, making it difficult to verify proper installation.

**Improvement Suggestion:**

Consider using `datetime.now()` for the timestamp to ensure it reflects the actual installation time and potentially include a version check using `getattr(ChatterboxTTS, '__version__')` if the library provides one.
Code:
```
ChatterboxTTS installed on: 2025-06-28T07:43:34.574608...
```
