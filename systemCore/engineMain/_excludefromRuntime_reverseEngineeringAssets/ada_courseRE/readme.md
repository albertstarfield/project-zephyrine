# Ada on macOS, Linux, & Windows: A Developer's Survival Guide

This document serves as a personal field manual for developing robust, portable Ada applications using the Alire (`alr`) and GNAT toolchain. It is the result of extensive debugging and reverse-engineering of the build process on macOS and provides a clear, reliable workflow for all platforms.

## 1. Core Philosophy: Robustness Through Portability

After encountering numerous issues with toolchain configurations and library compatibility, the guiding principle for all future projects is: **prioritize maximum portability and robustness.**

This means:
*   **Favor Standard Libraries:** Use libraries defined in the Ada Language Standard (`Ada.*`, `Interfaces.*`) as the first choice.
*   **Avoid GNAT-Specific Libraries:** While convenient, libraries like `GNAT.OS_Lib` are non-standard and have demonstrated inconsistent behavior or availability across different toolchain versions or platforms. They are a source of portability risk and should be avoided for critical code.
*   **Embrace C Bindings for OS Interaction:** For low-level tasks, the most reliable method is to bind directly to the underlying C library functions of the operating system. This gives ultimate control and bypasses any abstractions that might be incomplete or buggy.

## 2. The Role of `Interfaces.C`: The "Manual Transmission"

The decision to use C bindings is a powerful but deliberate trade-off. It should be reserved for the **1%** of the code that absolutely must interface with the raw operating system. The other **99%** of the application logic should remain in pure, safe Ada.

Using `Interfaces.C` is **exactly like switching a car from an automatic to a manual transmission.**

| Feature | **Pure Ada (Automatic)** | **Ada with `Interfaces.C` (Manual)** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **How it Works** | The compiler and runtime handle dangerous details for you automatically. | You are given direct, low-level control and are responsible for every step. |
| **Memory** | **Automatic.** Memory is managed for you (RAII). The car shifts gears for you. | **Manual.** You are responsible for every `malloc`/`free` or `New_String`/`Free`. You are shifting the gears yourself. |
| **Safety** | **High.** The language prevents common errors like null pointer access and buffer overflows at compile-time or with runtime checks. | **None.** The safety net is removed at the C boundary. Mistakes lead to crashes. The system assumes the driver is an expert. |
| **Result of a Mistake** | A compile-time error or a handleable runtime exception. | A `Segmentation fault` (segfault) or other undefined behavior. |

**Conclusion on Reliability:**
This approach is used to create a small, well-defined, and intensely scrutinized "wrapper" package in your Ada code. You build a tiny, unsafe bridge to C, and then the rest of your large, safe Ada application can use that bridge without ever having to touch C directly again, thus preserving the overall safety of the system.

## 3. Case Study: The "Not Declared in OS_Lib" Mystery

This is one of the most common and confusing errors for newcomers to GNAT.

**The Symptom:**
A new project fails to compile with a large wall of errors like `"No_Process_Id" not declared in "OS_Lib"` and `missing argument for parameter "Output_File" in call to "Spawn" declared at s-os_lib.ads`.

**Diagnosis:**
The compiler is not using the intended user-facing `GNAT.OS_Lib` library. Instead, it has fallen back to an internal, low-level package `System.OS_Lib` (found in `s-os_lib.ads`). This happens because the source code is missing the correct `with` clause.

**The Solution:**
The fix is to be explicit: `with GNAT.OS_Lib;`. However, given the portability issues discovered, the **recommended solution is to avoid `GNAT.OS_Lib` entirely** and use a C binding instead.

> **Warning!**
> Be cautious when using `GNAT.OS_Lib`. Experience has shown this non-standard library can cause significant build and portability issues.

## 4. The Alire Environment: Why `alr exec --` is Essential

A fundamental concept of Alire is that it creates a managed, self-contained environment for each project. It does **not** install compilers or libraries globally. This is why we must use the `alr exec --` command.

The command `alr exec -- <command>` acts as a "gatekeeper" that reads the project's manifest and constructs a temporary, perfectly configured environment for the command to run in. This ensures the correct GNAT version and all third-party dependencies are found.

**The Golden Rule:** Any tool that needs to interact with your project's specific compiler or dependencies **MUST be run via `alr exec --`**.

## 5. Case Study: Alire Dependency and Toolchain Hell

Attempting to use third-party libraries like `ashell` can fail if the toolchain is not correctly configured.

**The Symptom:** `alr with ashell` failed with `Missing: +‚ùó gcc ^11.2.4`.

**Diagnosis:** The library declared a dependency on a GNAT/GCC compiler, but Alire was checking the system's default `gcc` (Apple `clang`) and failing.

**The Fix:**
1. Run `alr toolchain --select`.
2. From the interactive menu, choose the `gnat_native` option, **not** "None" or "system".

## 6. Project Build Workflow: The "zephy" StellaIcarus Daemon Module

This section provides a complete, step-by-step workflow for initializing, building, and running a new Ada project, using the "zephy" module as an example. This process synthesizes all the lessons learned in this document.

### Step 1: Project Initialization

Create a new binary crate using Alire. The `-n` flag accepts all defaults for a quick, clean setup.

```bash
alr -n init --bin zephy
cd zephy
```

### Step 2: Adding Dependencies (If Necessary)

This project follows the philosophy of minimizing third-party dependencies. However, if a library were needed, the process is:

1.  **Add the dependency to the manifest:**
    ```bash
    alr with <library_name>
    ```
2.  **Fetch the source code:**
    ```bash
    alr update
    ```

### Step 3: Writing the Application Code

Place your main source file in the `src/` directory. By convention, the main procedure and the filename should match.

1.  Create the main file, e.g., `src/zephy_daemon.adb`.
2.  Write the application logic, using C bindings for OS interaction as needed.
3.  Update the project file (`zephy.gpr`) to point to your main file:
    ```gpr
    project Zephy is
       for Main use ("zephy_daemon.adb");
       -- ...
    end Zephy;
    ```

### Step 4: Building the Executable

The build command is OS-dependent due to linker variations.

**For macOS:**
Use the explicit command that specifies the system SDK path. This has proven to be the most reliable method.
```bash
alr exec -- gprbuild -largs -L"$(xcrun --show-sdk-path)/usr/lib"
```

**For Linux & Windows:**
These systems typically do not require the linker workaround.
```bash
alr exec -- gprbuild
```

Upon success, the compiled executable will be located at `bin/zephy_daemon`.

### Step 5: Running the Daemon

Execute the program directly from the `bin` directory. This is more explicit and reliable than using `alr run`.

```bash
./bin/zephy_daemon
```

This workflow provides a robust and repeatable process for all future Ada development.

## 7. The "Ghost in the Machine" Protocol: The Ultimate Reset

When the build system behaves illogically (e.g., compiling a phantom version of a file), the environment is irrecoverably corrupt.

**The "Nuke and Pave" Procedure:**
1.  **Back up and remove the Alire cache:** `mv ~/.alire ~/.alire_BACKUP`
2.  **Clean the shell config:** Edit `~/.zshrc` and remove the line adding `.alire/bin` to your `PATH`.
3.  **Restart the terminal completely.**
4.  **Reinstall Alire from scratch:** `curl -sS https://alire.ada.dev/install.py | python3`
5.  **Restart the terminal again.** This provides a truly clean slate.

> Note: I am not expecting to understand Ada directly but it's better if you transitioned from javascipt to transition to golang first. then jump to Ada, also make sure that alr (alire) packages or libraries can be portable like go tidy into the project folder rather than ~/.local/share which make things messy like huggingface trying to store model whatever it wanted to be. oh and AI doesn't knows about most of alire packaging so good luck vibe coders.
