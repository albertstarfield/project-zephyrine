I have completed the requested changes:

1.  **Consolidated Documentation**: All documentation related to the DCTD branch predictor, including the implementation plan and architectural summary, has been consolidated into a single file: `systemCore/engineMain/branchpredictor_dctd/branchpredictor_dctd.md`.

2.  **Renamed Python File**: The file `branch_predictor_provider.py` has been renamed to `dctd_branchpredictor.py` and is located in `systemCore/engineMain/`.

3.  **Updated Imports**: The main application logic in `AdelaideAlbertCortex.py` has been updated to import the `BranchPredictorProvider` from the new filename.

4.  **Cleaned Up Old Files**: All old documentation files (`BranchPredictor_TODO.md`, `Architecture_Summary.md`, etc.) have been deleted.

The project structure is now updated as you requested.
