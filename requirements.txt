#                            Notes & Considerations                            #
#                                                                              #
# 1. Virtual Environment: It is STRONGLY recommended to install these in a     #
#    Python virtual environment to avoid conflicts with system packages.       #
#    (e.g., `python -m venv venv` then `source venv/bin/activate`)             #
#                                                                              #
# 2. llama-cpp-python: This file lists the standard PyPI package. Your         #
#    `launcher.py` script handles a custom build from a specific fork. Ensure #
#    the launcher logic is up-to-date if the fork changes.                     #
#                                                                              #
# 3. Poppler (for pdf2image): This is a system dependency. See notes above.    #
#                                                                              #
# 4. TTS/STT Dependencies: The large block of TTS/STT related packages seems   #
#    quite specific. If they are not core to the LLM/agent functionality,      #
#    consider moving them to an optional requirements file (e.g.,              #
#    `requirements_speech.txt`) to keep the core setup lighter.                #
#                                                                              #
# 5. Torch/Transformers: These are heavy dependencies. Ensure they are         #
#    actually required by a component you are actively using. If only for a   #
#    small utility or optional feature, evaluate if lighter alternatives exist #
#    or if they can be made optional.                                          #
#                                                                              #
# 6. Pinning Versions: For production or reproducible environments, consider   #
#    pinning package versions (e.g., `Flask==2.3.2`). You can generate a      #
#    pinned list from your working environment using `pip freeze >             #
#    requirements_pinned.txt`.                                                #
